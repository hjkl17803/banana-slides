## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself caught in this dilemma: the presentation is due tomorrow, but the slides are still a total blank; your mind is full of brilliant ideas, yet all your enthusiasm is drained by tedious layout and design?

We long for the ability to quickly create presentations that are both professional and visually stunning. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the "speed" requirement, they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult.
- 3️⃣ Finished products look strikingly similar, with severe homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack relevance and specificity.
- 5️⃣ Fragmented image-text layouts with poor design aesthetics.

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our two core needs: "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, still far from being truly "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has changed everything. I experimented with 🍌pro for PPT page generation and found that the results were exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can accurately render almost all text from the prompts and faithfully follow the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate beautiful PPTs with zero threshold and no design experience required, reducing the hassle of template selection.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Reference AI-generated layouts and combinations of text and image elements to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Quickly convert teaching content into lesson plan PPTs with illustrations to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete assignment presentations, focusing energy on content rather than layout and beautification.
5. **Professionals**: Rapidly visualize business proposals and product introductions, with quick adaptation to multiple scenarios.

<p>
  <b>🎯 Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, enabling everyone to quickly create beautiful and professional presentations.</b>
</p>

**Use the new editable export configuration method for better results**: You need to obtain an API KEY from the [Baidu Intelligent Cloud Platform](https://console.bce.baidu.com/iam/#/iam/apikey/list) (click here to enter), and fill it into the `BAIDU_API_KEY` field in the `.env` file (it comes with a generous free usage quota). See the instructions in https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121 for details.


<details>
  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (for GCP users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models through GCP service accounts, and new users can use the free credit quota. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account, and download the JSON format key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set the following in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If deploying with Docker, you also need to uncomment the relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml` to mount the key file into the container and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`.

</details>

2. **Starting the Service**

**⚡ Using Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest version of the main branch). You can skip the local build steps to achieve rapid deployment:

```bash

# Launch with Pre-built Images (No Need to Build from Scratch)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> In case of network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file, and then rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following lines in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/
> ```


3. **Accessing the Application**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000

### Deploy from Source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for exporting explanation videos; must include `libass` / `ass` subtitle filter support
- A valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when uploading PPTX files using the "PPT Refurbishment" feature to convert PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading.** Reason: Server-side rendering via LibreOffice may cause layout misalignment due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore some special effects. LibreOffice is not required when uploading PDF files. For Docker users who still need to support PPTX uploads within the container, run:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed via this method will be lost after the container is rebuilt and will need to be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run the following in the project root directory:
```bash

# macOS (Homebrew)

brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full

# Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9
```

# Then install Python dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure environment variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

# Then follow the previously mentioned method to open and edit the `.env` file to configure your API key
